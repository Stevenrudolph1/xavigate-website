                    <p class="book-landing-hook">When did understanding someone become a way of not seeing them?</p>
                    <p class="book-landing-desc">
                        Labels don't describe people&mdash;they replace them. The moment we explain someone, curiosity closes. Understanding becomes a container, and the person disappears inside it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-landing-desc">
                        This book exposes the moment when explanation replaces observation. It traces how labels arrive, how competence becomes proof, and how frameworks themselves can press too hard&mdash;becoming the very thing they were meant to prevent.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-landing-desc">
                        It explores how to see without fixing, categorizing, or concluding. How to hold evidence without treating it as essence. How to orient toward a person without defining them.

                <h2>What Shifts After Reading</h2>
                <p>
                    You start to notice when your understanding of someone has solidified into a container&mdash;and you learn to keep it open. The book doesn't ask you to stop understanding. It asks you to notice when understanding has replaced seeing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Evidence is not essence. Patterns that you observe don't define the person. This distinction changes how you hold what you know about the people you work with.
