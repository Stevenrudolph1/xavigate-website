                        The pull to fix, help, explain, or comfort kicks in before the situation has shown you what it actually needs. You're not standing in the wrong place on purpose&mdash;you just don't know you're standing anywhere.

                        <em>The Engagement Map</em> maps the structural layer beneath practitioner skill. It shows three attending positions&mdash;attending, discriminating, and contacting&mdash;and five response modes. Where you attend from governs what your skills can access. Most people never see the position, only the result.

                        This book is for anyone who engages with other people professionally&mdash;coaches, therapists, educators, facilitators, leaders&mdash;and suspects that technique alone isn't the problem.

                <p>
                    You start to notice where you're standing before you act. The map distinguishes three attending positions&mdash;and shows how most practitioners collapse into one without knowing it. That collapse isn't a skill deficit. It's a structural pattern called mode collapse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you see the positions, you stop trying to improve your technique and start noticing what your technique can't access from where you're standing. The skill was never the problem&mdash;the position was.
