                    <p class="book-landing-hook">What happens when you stop trying to understand, stop trying to help, and stop trying to respond?</p>
                    <p class="book-landing-desc">
                        Three reflexes close what's still open: understanding (completes before it's finished), helping (converts experience to problem), and responding (fills silence before it's spoken into). These aren't failures. They're automatic completions&mdash;and they operate before intention.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-landing-desc">
                        <em>On Witnessing</em> explores what remains when those reflexes cease. Not passive observation. Not empathy. Not doing nothing. Witnessing is presence without completion&mdash;the most fundamental and least understood attending stance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-landing-desc">
                        This is the deepest book in the Positioning area. It examines what practitioners stand on when they're not standing on technique.

                <h2>What Shifts After Reading</h2>
                <p>
                    You start to see the three reflexes operating&mdash;understanding, helping, responding&mdash;and you notice how each one closes what was still forming. Not because they're wrong, but because they arrive before the moment is ready for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Witnessing is not empathy, not doing nothing, and not passivity. It's the attending stance that remains when automatic completion stops. This book doesn't teach you to witness&mdash;it helps you see what gets in the way.
