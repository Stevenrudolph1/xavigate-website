                    <p class="book-landing-desc">
                        The job, the relationship, the commitment&mdash;it still functions, but it takes more than it gives back. You're not failing. You're enduring. And endurance has been mistaken for fit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-landing-desc">
                        <em>Renergence</em> names the pattern most people feel but can't articulate: when sustained engagement stops returning more than it takes. Not in a single moment, but over time&mdash;the cost hides early and compounds quietly, while success disguises extraction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-landing-desc">
                        This book doesn't tell you what to do. It names what's happening&mdash;so you can stop blaming yourself for what the situation is doing to you.

                    You stop asking "What's wrong with me?" and start asking "What is this situation actually costing?" The frame moves from personal failure to structural recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You learn to distinguish between what energizes at the start and what sustains over time&mdash;because the beginning tells you almost nothing about the long-term cost. And you see how success itself can disguise extraction.

                    <em>Renergence</em> is the entry point to the full framework. It names the signal. The three books that follow&mdash;Structure, Alignment, and Positioning&mdash;diagnose what's causing it.
