                        Maybe you know. The job drains you and you dread Monday. Maybe you don't. You're succeeding&mdash;but something's off and you can't name it. Or maybe it's neither: things are fine, just&hellip; flat. Not bad enough to leave, not good enough to stay without wondering.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-landing-desc">
                        All three are the same pattern. What you're in has stopped returning more than it takes. The timing, the speed, the visibility&mdash;those vary. The structural fact doesn't.

                        <em>Renergence</em> names that pattern&mdash;so you can see what's actually happening instead of guessing, enduring, or blaming yourself for what the situation is doing to you.

                    You stop guessing and start seeing. Whether the cost is obvious, hidden behind success, or just a slow fade&mdash;you learn to read the actual return instead of the story about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You learn to distinguish between what energizes at the start and what sustains over time&mdash;because the beginning tells you almost nothing about the long-term cost. And you stop asking "What's wrong with me?" when the answer is structural.

                    <em>Renergence</em> is the entry point to the full framework. It names the signal. The three books that follow&mdash;Structure, Alignment, and Positioning&mdash;diagnose what's causing it.
