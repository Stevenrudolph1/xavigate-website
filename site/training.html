                Learn to see what's actually going wrong in a situation — not the story people tell about it. Whether someone is burned out, performing fine but off, or just quietly flat — there's usually a condition underneath that no one is looking at. This training teaches you to find it.

                <h2>Who This Is For</h2>

                <p>You work with people. Someone is struggling — burned out, stuck, quietly flat — and you're the one in the room trying to figure out what's actually going on. You've tried the obvious moves: coaching on boundaries, resilience conversations, mindset shifts. Sometimes they help. Often they don't hold. That's because they're aimed at the person — and the problem is usually somewhere else.</p>

                <p>This training is for practitioners who want to stop guessing and start seeing the structural cause. That includes:</p>

                <ul class="pricing-features">
                    <li><strong>Coaches</strong> who sense the issue is deeper than what the client is saying — and want a framework for finding it</li>
                    <li><strong>HR and OD professionals</strong> who keep solving the same problems because the real cause hasn't been addressed</li>
                    <li><strong>Managers and team leads</strong> who want to understand why good people deplete in roles that should work</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapists and counselors</strong> who see workplace distress that isn't clinical — and want a structural read, not just a clinical one</li>
                    <li><strong>Consultants</strong> who advise on people, teams, or organizations and want to diagnose before they prescribe</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You don't need a specific credential to start. You need to work with people and want a sharper read on what's actually happening.</p>

    <!-- How the Training Works -->

        <div class="container">
            <div class="about-content">
                <h2>How the Training Works</h2>

                <p>Start with the foundation, then go deep in the area where your work lives.</p>

                <h3>Build a Learning Portfolio</h3>
                <p>Most courses hand you content and check whether you absorbed it. This one asks you to <em>use</em> it — on real situations, from the beginning. You build a Learning Portfolio: a set of documents where you do your analysis, work through exercises, and develop your own case work. By the end, you haven't just studied the framework. You've built a body of practiced analysis that shows how you think.</p>

                <h3>Everything Is Yours to Keep</h3>
                <p>No platform. No login. No software that expires. When you enroll, you receive the complete course materials — manual, exercises, case walkthroughs, submission prompts. They're yours permanently. Only the submission window has a deadline.</p>

                <h3>How Review Works</h3>
                <p>When you submit your portfolio, Steven Rudolph reviews your work directly inside your documents — inline comments on where your analysis landed, where it drifted, and what a sharper read would look like. You also receive a final review report. It's not a grade. It's a detailed, honest read of how you're seeing.</p>

                <h3>Two Tracks, Same Standard</h3>
                <p>Every course is available in two tracks. <strong>Self-Paced</strong> gives you the complete materials, your Learning Portfolio, and expert review. <strong>With Live Instructor</strong> adds up to 2.5 hours of 1-on-1 time via Zoom — working through your actual cases, getting real-time feedback, and calibrating your reads against expert analysis.</p>

                        MN lives inside the Renergence framework — it's the part about what naturally engages people. If you already know MN, your skills transfer directly — you're further along than you think.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong><em>Multiple Natures Revisited</em></strong> is a short, free book that explains how MN fits into the bigger picture. It connects what you already know to the full Renergence framework and shows where Structure and Positioning go beyond what MN covers.

                        Everyone starts at the Foundation — the diagnostic seeing course is new even for experienced MN practitioners. But the Alignment course will feel like home.
