                Learn to see what's actually going wrong in a situation — not the story people tell about it. When someone is depleted, overloaded, or stuck, there's usually a condition underneath that no one is looking at. This training teaches you to find it.

                <h2>How It Works</h2>

                <p>Start with the foundation, then go deep in the area where your work lives. No platform. No login. No software that expires. You get the materials, build a Learning Portfolio, and submit your case work for expert review.</p>

                <p>Every course is available in two tracks — same materials, same standard. The difference is whether you also get live time with Steven Rudolph.</p>

                    Each course ends with case submissions from your Learning Portfolio — real situations analyzed using what you learned. Steven reviews your work directly inside your documents with inline feedback, plus a final review report. Cases that show you can see past the story to the real issue earn completion. One revision is included; a second is available for a $100 resubmission fee.

                        MN lives inside the Renergence framework — it's the part about what naturally engages people. If you already know MN, your skills transfer directly — you're further along than you think.

                    <p>
                        <strong><em>Multiple Natures Revisited</em></strong> is a short, free book that explains how MN fits into the bigger picture. It connects what you already know to the full Renergence framework and shows where Structure and Positioning go beyond what MN covers.

                    <p>
                        Everyone starts at the Foundation — the diagnostic seeing course is new even for experienced MN practitioners. But the Alignment course will feel like home.
