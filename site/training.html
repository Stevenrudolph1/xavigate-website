                When something isn't working — and you can't tell why — the problem isn't your skill. It's that you're diagnosing in the dark. This training gives you a clean way to locate where a problem actually lives, before you try to fix it.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <main>
    <!-- The problem practitioners already feel -->
    <section class="about-section">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="about-content">

                <p class="course-hook">You've been in this situation. A client is stuck. You try one angle. It helps a little. Then it fades. You try a different framing. A different tool. Still not quite it.</p>

                <p class="course-hook">The problem isn't that you lack skill. It's that everything blends together.</p>

                <p>Without a way to locate the real issue, exhaustion looks like a mindset problem. A bad fit looks like burnout. Being overloaded by a broken setup looks like weak boundaries. Getting stuck in one way of engaging looks like a personality flaw. So you compensate by adding more tools. More frameworks. More certifications. More methods.</p>

                <p>But adding tools doesn't solve a wrong location. Diagnosis does.</p>

                <h2>What Changes When You Can Diagnose</h2>

                <div class="reframe reframe--hnr">
                    <p class="reframe__before">"Let's work on your boundaries."</p>
                    <p class="reframe__after">This isn't a boundary issue. The load is mislocated &mdash; something is missing in how this situation is set up, and one person is carrying what the arrangement should hold.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="reframe reframe--mn">
                    <p class="reframe__before">"Maybe you're in the wrong career."</p>
                    <p class="reframe__after">The career might be fine for someone else. For this person, the situation demands one kind of engagement while they naturally supply another &mdash; sometimes obviously, sometimes invisibly. That gap has a name: it's an alignment problem, and the Multiple Natures model shows you exactly where it lives.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="reframe reframe--engagement">
                    <p class="reframe__before">"I need to be more present with clients."</p>
                    <p class="reframe__after">I'm not failing at presence. I'm stuck in one way of engaging and can't shift &mdash; whether that's jumping in too fast, pulling back too far, or analyzing when I should be in it.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Clarity reduces effort. Precision replaces guessing. You stop stacking interventions and start working where the problem actually is.</p>

                <h2>Who This Is For</h2>

                <p>You already work with people in complex situations. You're the one in the room trying to figure out what's actually happening underneath. This training sharpens that read.</p>

                <ul class="pricing-features">
                    <li><strong>Coaches and executive coaches</strong> who sense the issue is deeper than what the client is saying</li>
                    <li><strong>HR and OD professionals</strong> who keep solving the same problem in different forms</li>
                    <li><strong>Managers and team leads</strong> who see good people deplete in roles that should work</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapists and counselors</strong> who see workplace distress that isn't clinical</li>
                    <li><strong>Consultants</strong> who advise on people, teams, or organizations and need to diagnose before they prescribe</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You don't need a specific credential. You don't need another toolbox. You need a cleaner map.</p>

                <h2>The Training Pathway</h2>

                <p>You learn the diagnostic model first. Then you go deep in the area where your work lives. The pathway is modular — take one course or build full capability over time.</p>

                <div class="training-callout training-callout--renergence">
                    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Foundations in Renergence — learn to separate the three places problems live</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose a Focus Track — go deep in Structure, Alignment (where the Multiple Natures model lives), or Positioning</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 3 (optional):</strong> MNTEST — learn to measure what the Alignment course teaches you to see</p>
                </div>

                <p>Most practitioners start with Foundation + one Focus Track. You can stop at any point. Every course stands on its own.</p>

                    Each course ends with case submissions from your Learning Portfolio — real situations analyzed using what you learned. Steven reviews your work directly inside your documents with inline feedback, plus a final review report. Cases that show you can see past the story to the real issue earn completion.

                    Completion means you can reference the training in your professional materials, say you're trained in the Renergence framework, and describe that you use Renergence diagnosis in your work. Completers can also opt in to a public directory — a factual list of people who did the work.

                        MN lives inside the Renergence framework — it's the part about what naturally engages people. If you already know MN, your skills transfer directly — you're further along than you think.

                    <p>
                        <strong><em>Multiple Natures Revisited</em></strong> is a short, free book that explains how MN fits into the bigger picture. It connects what you already know to the full Renergence framework and shows where Structure and Positioning go beyond what MN covers.

                    <p>
                        Everyone starts at the Foundation — the diagnostic seeing course is new even for experienced MN practitioners. But the Alignment course will feel like home.
