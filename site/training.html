                When something isn't working — and you can't tell why — the problem isn't your skill. It's that you're diagnosing in the dark. This training gives you a clean way to locate where a problem actually lives, before you try to fix it.

        <div class="container">
            <div class="about-content">

                <p class="course-hook">You've been in this situation. A client is stuck. You try one angle. It helps a little. Then it fades. You try a different framing. A different tool. Still not quite it.</p>

                <p class="course-hook">The problem isn't that you lack skill. It's that everything blends together.</p>

                <p>Without a diagnostic frame, exhaustion looks like a mindset issue. Misfit looks like burnout. Structural overload looks like weak boundaries. Engagement collapse looks like a personality problem. So you compensate by adding more tools. More frameworks. More certifications. More methods.</p>

                <p>But adding tools doesn't solve mislocation. Diagnosis does.</p>

                <h2>What Changes When You Can Diagnose</h2>

                <p>Instead of: <em>"Let's work on your boundaries."</em><br>
                You can see: <strong>This isn't a boundary issue. The load is mislocated — something is missing in how the work is set up.</strong></p>

                <p>Instead of: <em>"Maybe you're in the wrong career."</em><br>
                You can see: <strong>The career may be fine. The arrangement is fighting the person's natural pattern of engagement.</strong></p>

                <p>Instead of: <em>"I need to be more present with clients."</em><br>
                You can see: <strong>I'm not failing at presence. I'm stuck in one way of engaging and can't shift.</strong></p>

                <p>Clarity reduces effort. Precision replaces guessing. You stop stacking interventions and start working where the problem actually is.</p>

                <h2>Who This Is For</h2>

                <p>You already work with people in complex situations. You're the one in the room trying to figure out what's actually happening underneath. This training sharpens that read.</p>

                <ul class="pricing-features">
                    <li><strong>Coaches and executive coaches</strong> who sense the issue is deeper than what the client is saying</li>
                    <li><strong>HR and OD professionals</strong> who keep solving the same problem in different forms</li>
                    <li><strong>Managers and team leads</strong> who see good people deplete in roles that should work</li>
                    <li><strong>Therapists and counselors</strong> who see workplace distress that isn't clinical</li>
                    <li><strong>Consultants</strong> who advise on people, teams, or organizations and need to diagnose before they prescribe</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You don't need a specific credential. You don't need another toolbox. You need a cleaner map.</p>

                <h2>The Training Pathway</h2>

                <p>You learn the diagnostic model first. Then you go deep in the area where your work lives. The pathway is modular — take one course or build full capability over time.</p>

                <div class="training-callout training-callout--renergence">
                    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Foundations in Renergence — learn to separate the three places problems live</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose a Focus Track — go deep in Structure, Alignment, or Positioning</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 3 (optional):</strong> MNTEST — learn to measure engagement fit with an assessment tool</p>
                </div>

                <p>Most practitioners start with Foundation + one Focus Track. You can stop at any point. Every course stands on its own.</p>

    <!-- How the Training Works -->
    <section class="about-section panel-hnr">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="about-content">
                <h2>How the Training Works</h2>

                <h3>Build a Learning Portfolio</h3>
                <p>Most courses hand you content and check whether you absorbed it. This one asks you to <em>use</em> it — on real situations, from the beginning. You build a Learning Portfolio: a set of documents where you do your analysis, work through exercises, and develop your own case work. By the end, you've built a body of practiced analysis that shows how you think.</p>

                <h3>Everything Is Yours to Keep</h3>
                <p>No platform. No login. No software that expires. When you enroll, you receive the complete course materials — manual, exercises, case walkthroughs, submission prompts. They're yours permanently. Only the submission window has a deadline.</p>

                <h3>How Review Works</h3>
                <p>When you submit your portfolio, Steven Rudolph reviews your work directly inside your documents — inline comments on where your analysis landed, where it drifted, and what a sharper read would look like. You also receive a final review report. It's not a grade. It's a detailed, honest read of how you're seeing.</p>

                <h3>Two Tracks, Same Standard</h3>
                <p>Every course is available in two tracks. <strong>Self-Paced</strong> gives you the complete materials, your Learning Portfolio, and expert review. <strong>With Live Instructor</strong> adds up to 2.5 hours of 1-on-1 time via Zoom — working through your actual cases, getting real-time feedback, and calibrating your reads against expert analysis.</p>

                <p>
                    Each course ends with case submissions from your Learning Portfolio — real situations analyzed using what you learned. Steven reviews your work directly inside your documents with inline feedback, plus a final review report. Cases that show you can see past the story to the real issue earn completion.

                    Completion means you can reference the training in your professional materials, say you're trained in the Renergence framework, and describe that you use Renergence diagnosis in your work. Completers can also opt in to a public directory — a factual list of people who did the work.

                        MN lives inside the Renergence framework — it's the part about what naturally engages people. If you already know MN, your skills transfer directly — you're further along than you think.

                    <p>
                        <strong><em>Multiple Natures Revisited</em></strong> is a short, free book that explains how MN fits into the bigger picture. It connects what you already know to the full Renergence framework and shows where Structure and Positioning go beyond what MN covers.

                    <p>
                        Everyone starts at the Foundation — the diagnostic seeing course is new even for experienced MN practitioners. But the Alignment course will feel like home.
