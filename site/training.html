                When something isn't working &mdash; and you can't tell why &mdash; the problem isn't your skill. It's that you're diagnosing in the dark. This training gives you a clean way to locate where a problem actually lives, before you try to fix it.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <main>
    <!-- The problem practitioners already feel -->
    <section class="about-section">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="about-content">

                <p class="course-hook">You've been in this situation. A client is stuck. You try one angle. It helps a little. Then it fades. You try a different framing. A different tool. Still not quite it.</p>

                <p class="course-hook">The problem isn't that you lack skill. It's that everything blends together.</p>

                <p>Without a way to locate the real issue, exhaustion looks like a mindset problem. A bad fit looks like burnout. Being overloaded by a broken setup looks like weak boundaries. Getting stuck in one way of engaging looks like a personality flaw. So you compensate by adding more tools. More frameworks. More certifications. More methods.</p>

                <p>But adding tools doesn't solve a wrong location. Diagnosis does.</p>

                <h2>What Changes When You Can Diagnose</h2>

                <div class="reframe reframe--hnr">
                    <p class="reframe__before">"Let's work on your boundaries."</p>
                    <p class="reframe__after">This isn't a boundary issue. The load is mislocated &mdash; something is missing in how this situation is set up, and one person is carrying what the arrangement should hold.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="reframe reframe--mn">
                    <p class="reframe__before">"Maybe you're in the wrong career."</p>
                    <p class="reframe__after">The career might be fine for someone else. For this person, the situation demands one kind of engagement while they naturally supply another &mdash; sometimes obviously, sometimes invisibly. That gap has a name: it's an alignment problem, and the Multiple Natures model shows you exactly where it lives.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="reframe reframe--engagement">
                    <p class="reframe__before">"I need to be more present with clients."</p>
                    <p class="reframe__after">I'm not failing at presence. I'm stuck in one way of engaging and can't shift &mdash; whether that's jumping in too fast, pulling back too far, or analyzing when I should be in it.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Clarity reduces effort. Precision replaces guessing. You stop stacking interventions and start working where the problem actually is.</p>

                <ul class="pricing-features">
                    <li>You've been coaching, consulting, or facilitating for years &mdash; and you still can't reliably tell whether the problem is the person or the arrangement</li>
                    <li>You've watched clients improve in sessions and stall between them &mdash; and you suspect the structure around them is the issue, not their motivation</li>
                    <li>You've seen "burnout," "boundaries," and "career misfit" diagnosed interchangeably &mdash; and you know they're not the same thing</li>
                    <li>You've tried frameworks that describe personality but don't explain why the same person thrives in one arrangement and depletes in another</li>
                    <li>You want a cleaner diagnostic lens, not another toolbox</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="pricing-features">

                <h2>The Books Give You Recognition. The Training Builds Diagnostic Skill.</h2>

                <p>The books name the patterns. They expose common misdiagnoses. They reveal the structural conditions underneath personal narratives. If you've read them, you already see differently.</p>

                <p>The training is where that recognition becomes <em>precision</em>. You learn to detect without premature closure. To distinguish between problems that look identical on the surface but live in completely different places. To hold a structural read under pressure &mdash; when the client's story, your instincts, and the obvious explanation are all pulling you toward the wrong diagnosis.</p>

                <p>The books are free. The skill is not.</p>

                <h2>The Training Pathway</h2>

                <p>You learn the diagnostic model first. Then you go deep in the area where your work lives. The pathway is modular &mdash; take one course or build full capability over time.</p>

                <div class="training-callout training-callout--renergence">
                    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Foundations in Renergence &mdash; learn to separate the three places problems live</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose a Focus Track &mdash; go deep in Structure, Alignment (where the Multiple Natures model lives), or Positioning</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 3 (optional):</strong> MNTEST &mdash; learn to measure what the Alignment course teaches you to see</p>
                </div>

                <p>Most practitioners start with Foundation + one Focus Track. You can stop at any point. Every course stands on its own.</p>

                        <p>Every situation pulls for certain kinds of engagement. When what someone naturally supplies matches what the situation demands, energy comes back. When it doesn't, they pay for every hour &mdash; sometimes obviously, sometimes behind years of competence, sometimes as a flatness they can't quite name. The <strong>Multiple Natures</strong> model maps that gap: what engages them vs. what they're forcing.</p>

                <h2>Personalization Add-On</h2>

                <p class="course-hook">Most training gives everyone the same path. That works &mdash; but it means you're constantly translating the material into your own context. Your industry. Your clients. Your constraints.</p>

                <p>The Personalization Add-On does that translation for you.</p>

                <p>You provide structured context about your situation &mdash; your industry, your role, the kinds of problems you encounter, the people you work with, your constraints. We map the course material to that context, so the examples, emphasis, and sequencing arrive already aligned to how you actually work.</p>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>

                <div class="course-mechanic-list">
                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>You provide context (15&ndash;30 minutes)</h3>
                        <p>Your industry, role, working environment, client types, current challenges, goals, and constraints. Via structured form, voice recording, or written narrative &mdash; whichever you prefer.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>We map it to the course</h3>
                        <p>Your context gets mapped to the program's framework. We reorder emphasis, add context-specific examples, adjust reflection prompts, highlight the modules most relevant to your situation, and suggest pacing based on your bandwidth.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>You receive a tailored version</h3>
                        <p>A personalized roadmap. Industry-relevant examples. Custom reflection prompts. Adjusted sequencing. The same diagnostic framework &mdash; instantiated for your specific situation.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>What This Changes</h3>

                <p>Without personalization, you interpret and synthesize. You read a case about a tech team and figure out how it applies to your hospital department, your coaching clients, your consulting practice.</p>

                <p>With personalization, that structural translation is already done. The abstraction distance shrinks. The guesswork drops. You spend your time on the diagnostic skill, not on figuring out how the material relates to you.</p>

                <div class="training-callout training-callout--renergence">
                    <p><strong>This is contextual mapping, not private coaching.</strong> We don't rewrite the program. We don't invent new frameworks. We don't guarantee outcomes. We take what's already here &mdash; the same diagnostic architecture &mdash; and instantiate it for your situation.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Who It's For</h3>

                <ul class="pricing-features">
                    <li>You work in a specific or complex industry and want the material to speak that language</li>
                    <li>You work with particular client types and want examples that match</li>
                    <li>You want clarity about how the framework applies to your situation, not just in general</li>
                    <li>You prefer structured relevance over doing all the synthesis yourself</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you're highly self-directed and enjoy doing your own translation, you may not need it.</p>
