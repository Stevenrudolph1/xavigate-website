                        When you license the frameworks (area-specific or complete), you get:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Complete framework materials and methodologies</li>

                    <h3>Where This Applies</h3>

                    <div class="use-case">
                        <h4>Coaching</h4>
                        <p>
                            Your client keeps adjusting themselves — and the advice they're getting assumes the problem is personal. Maybe the situation should have been designed differently. Maybe the work itself doesn't fit who they are. Maybe they're stuck in one way of engaging and can't see it. Those are three different conditions with three different interventions. Your existing toolkit probably handles one. This handles all three.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="use-case">
                        <h4>Organizational Consulting</h4>
                        <p>
                            The same people keep burning out. The org calls it "culture" or "engagement." But is the structure unsafe, the work misaligned with the people doing it, or is everyone stuck in one way of responding? Those are three different conditions. The frameworks separate them so the intervention matches.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="use-case">
                        <h4>Training &amp; Education</h4>
                        <p>
                            You're building programs that need a foundation beyond personality assessments and leadership models. These frameworks teach people to see conditions&mdash;not just traits. That changes what their effort can actually address.
