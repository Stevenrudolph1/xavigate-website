                <p>
                    The library is organized around one signal and three causes:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Renergence™</strong> — When something that once worked becomes quietly expensive to maintain
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-site-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-site-sm); font-size: var(--text-lg); font-weight: var(--weight-semibold);">The Causes</h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>Structure</strong> — Load-bearing architecture (<em>Heroes Not Required</em>)<br>
                    When outcomes depend on someone being exceptional instead of design being adequate
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Alignment</strong> — Your nature vs. what you're in (<em>Multiple Natures</em>)<br>
                    When you are competent at what you do, but drained by it—because the arrangement fights your wiring
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Positioning</strong> — Where you attend from (<em>The Engagement Map</em>)<br>
                    When you keep responding before you've actually seen what's happening
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: var(--space-site-md);">
                    Each includes an entry book and deeper material. Start with what you recognize. Then diagnose precisely.
                </p>
