                <h2>Steven Rudolph</h2>
                <p>Steven Rudolph has spent over 30 years studying why some situations work and others don&rsquo;t&mdash;not from the perspective of the person inside them, but from the perspective of the arrangement itself.</p>
                <p>His early work focused on engagement: what makes someone come alive in one context and go flat in another. That work produced the Multiple Natures framework, which has been used by educators and organizations across dozens of countries. It revealed that engagement isn&rsquo;t motivation. It&rsquo;s fit&mdash;and fit is measurable.</p>
                <p>Over time the question expanded. Fit explained part of the picture. But people also burned out in situations that fit them perfectly&mdash;because the arrangement was generating unsustainable load. And practitioners with strong skills still failed to see what was in front of them&mdash;because they were standing in the wrong place inside the interaction.</p>
                <p>Renergence is the integration of those three observations: how arrangements distribute load, whether the work fits the person doing it, and where the practitioner stands when they look. When any of these fails, the situation costs more than it returns.</p>

                <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
                <p>Most frameworks for understanding difficulty start with the person. What&rsquo;s wrong with them. What they should do differently. What they need to work on.</p>
                <p>Renergence starts with the arrangement. Not because people don&rsquo;t matter, but because the arrangement is usually generating the problem&mdash;and the person is absorbing the cost of a design that was never examined.</p>
                <p>The goal is not insight. The goal is to name the specific mechanism that is producing the cost, propose one structural change, and give you a way to test whether it worked.</p>
