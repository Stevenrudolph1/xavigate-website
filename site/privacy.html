                <h3>2.3 Information from Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>
                    If you authenticate through a third-party provider (such as Google), we receive limited profile information (name, email, profile picture) as authorized by you during the authentication flow. We access only the permissions you explicitly grant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For specific AI-powered tools that analyze behavioral metadata (such as the Mirror Engine), additional data access is described in the tool-specific privacy notice provided at the time of connection. Such tools require your explicit, separate consent before any data is accessed.
                </p>

                <h3>2.4 What We Do Not Collect</h3>
                <ul>

                <h2 id="ai-tools">5. AI-Powered Tools and Your Data</h2>
                <h3>5.1 What Data AI Tools Process</h3>
                <p>
                    When you use our AI-powered diagnostic tools, the text descriptions and other inputs you provide are processed to generate diagnostic outputs. Your inputs may be temporarily stored to deliver the output and may be retained in anonymized or aggregated form to improve the quality of our tools.
                </p>

                <h3>5.2 How AI Outputs Are Handled</h3>
                <p>
                    Diagnostic outputs (reports, assessments, recommendations) are generated for you and stored so you can access them again. Outputs are not shared with other users or made publicly accessible.
                </p>

                <h3>5.3 Third-Party AI Providers</h3>
                <p>
                    Our AI tools may use third-party AI providers (such as Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude) to process your inputs and generate outputs. When this occurs, your inputs are sent to the provider solely for the purpose of generating the output. We select providers that commit to not using your data to train their models. We do not send your name, email, or other identifying information to AI providers unless it is part of the input you provide.
                </p>

                <h3>5.4 Behavioral Metadata Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Certain tools (such as the Mirror Engine) may, with your explicit consent, access metadata from third-party accounts (e.g., Google Workspace). When you connect such an account:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We access only the metadata categories described in the tool-specific consent screen.</li>
                    <li>We do not read the content of your emails, calendar event details, or file attachments.</li>
                    <li>You can disconnect and delete all associated data at any time.</li>
                    <li>A separate, tool-specific privacy notice is provided at the time of connection.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5.5 AI Training Prohibition</h3>
                <div class="legal-highlight">
                    <p>
                        We do not use your personal data or diagnostic inputs to train, fine-tune, or improve AI or machine learning models. Your inputs are processed only to generate your requested outputs.
