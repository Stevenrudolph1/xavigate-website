                <h3>9.1 Licensing Required for Professional Use</h3>
                <p>
                    Any professional, commercial, or organizational use of Renergence Content requires a separate license. This includes using our frameworks, diagnostics, or methodologies with clients, in training programs, in software products, or in any commercial context.
                </p>
                <h3>9.2 Practitioner Licensing Tiers</h3>
                <p>
                    We offer practitioner licensing at multiple tiers, from basic distribution to certified practitioner status. Each tier grants specific usage rights and requires a separate license agreement. Details are available on our <a href="practitioners.html">Practitioner Licensing</a> page.
                </p>
                <h3>9.3 Commercial Embedding Licenses</h3>
                <p>
                    Any use of Renergence Content in software, AI systems, platforms, bots, or other technology products requires a Commercial Embedding License. This includes but is not limited to: incorporating frameworks into SaaS products, building AI agents using our diagnostic models, and embedding our assessments in third-party platforms. Commercial Embedding Licenses are subject to separate negotiation and additional terms.

                <p>
                    All practitioner licenses require human-mediated delivery. Practitioners may not deploy autonomous AI systems that diagnose, classify, advise, or make recommendations using Renergence Content without a separate Commercial Embedding License.

                    <p>
                        Practitioners who use Renergence frameworks with clients assume full local design responsibility for how they apply the intellectual property in context. Neither Steven Rudolph nor Renergence guarantees any specific outcome from the use of our frameworks, diagnostics, or methodologies. Structural plausibility is described; success is not promised.
