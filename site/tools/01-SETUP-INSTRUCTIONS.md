## Setup

### Claude (Anthropic)

1. Create a new Project
2. Upload the toolkit file (reader or practitioner edition) to the project knowledge
3. Upload the book files you want to work with
4. Start a conversation — the toolkit applies automatically

Works on the free plan. Pro ($20/mo) gives unlimited file uploads and stronger models.

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)

1. Start a new conversation
2. Upload the toolkit file and a book file
3. The AI will use the toolkit for that conversation

Works on the free plan. For persistent use, create a Custom GPT (requires Plus at $20/mo) and add the files there.

### Other AI Tools

1. Open your AI tool (Gemini, Cursor, or similar)
2. Upload or paste the toolkit file as project instructions
3. Upload the relevant book file

Any tool that accepts file uploads or system prompts will work.

## Which Toolkit Edition?

- **Reader Edition** — for personal use. Shapes AI toward diagnostic reasoning with the books.
- **Practitioner Edition** — for professional use with clients. Adds constraints for client work: hypothesis-only framing, no severity calibration, no intervention prescription.
