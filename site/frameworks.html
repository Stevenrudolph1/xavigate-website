                    Someone burns out. Everyone says "burnout." But is the structure unsafe, the work misaligned with who they are, or are they stuck in one way of responding? Those are three different conditions with three different fixes. Single-lens thinking picks one and treats them all the same.

The other three diagnose where the load is being generated. <strong>Heroes Not Required</strong> finds what's missing in the design. <strong>Multiple Natures</strong> separates competence from fit. <strong>The Engagement Map</strong> reveals the position you're engaging from.
