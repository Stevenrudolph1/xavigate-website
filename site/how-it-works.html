                    <strong>Renergence™</strong> is the signal—when what you're in takes more than it gives back. The job, the relationship, the commitment. It still functions, but the cost compounds and the return diminishes. You're not failing. You're enduring. And endurance has been mistaken for fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The work identifies where the load is being generated—and what changes it. The books name the pattern. The frameworks specify what to shift. The tools verify that load actually moved—not just in theory, but in what people are no longer carrying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developed over 30 years with more than 300,000 people navigating situations where familiar effort stopped working.
                </p>

                <h2>What Happens When You Use It</h2>
                <p>
                    Most approaches to stuck situations focus on the person: try harder, communicate better, develop new skills, change your mindset. This works differently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The operating sequence is:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. Recognize the signal.</strong> Something is off—what you're in takes more than it gives back. This is Renergence. The books help you see it clearly: not what's wrong with you, but that something in the design isn't giving back what it costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>2. Identify the cause.</strong> The cause is structure, alignment, positioning—or a combination. You check where load is misallocated (structure), where your nature doesn't match what you're in (alignment), or where you're attending from limits what's available (positioning). A bottleneck that looks like "poor delegation" is often a structure that routes everything through one node. Exhaustion that looks like "wrong career" is often the right work arranged in a way that fights your wiring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3. Make the move.</strong> The paid books specify concrete interventions: what changes, what it requires, how to tell whether load actually relocated. Every move includes what it does <em>not</em> promise&mdash;because precision about boundaries is what separates this work from motivational advice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>4. Verify the shift.</strong> Did the load move out of a person and into structure? Or did it just get renamed? The frameworks include verification criteria so you can tell the difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the full loop. Signal (Renergence) → diagnosis (structure / alignment / positioning) → specified move → verified shift.
                </p>

                <h2>What You Get</h2>
                <p>
                    Digital materials you own permanently&mdash;not access, not a platform, not a membership. Books in PDF, ePub, and audiobook. Frameworks. Diagnostic instruments. Practitioner tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no platform to log into. No subscription. Nothing expires. You download it, you keep it, you return to it when the situation requires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The library currently includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Four free entry books</strong>&mdash;each introduces a core pattern and what changes it</li>
                    <li><strong>Fourteen depth books</strong> (paid)&mdash;detailed diagnosis, specified moves, professional applications</li>
                    <li><strong>Practitioner materials</strong> (licensed)&mdash;training guides, assessment tools, professional usage rights</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is a reference system, not a content feed. The materials are designed to be used, set down, and picked up again when a new situation surfaces the pattern.
                </p>

                <h2>How You Use It</h2>

                <h3>Read</h3>
                <p>
                    Each book stands on its own. Read one, apply what it names, stop. Return later when a different situation calls for a different lens. There is no required sequence.
                </p>

                <h3>Apply</h3>
                <p>
                    The depth books specify structural moves&mdash;not advice, not principles, but named interventions with prerequisites, implementation steps, and verification criteria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's what that looks like concretely: one structural move is called <em>Threshold Approvals</em>. It addresses the pattern where every decision routes through one person&mdash;not because they're controlling, but because the structure never defined what doesn't need them. The move specifies exactly what changes (approval criteria become explicit), what must be true first (you can distinguish genuine escalation from structural default), and how to verify it worked (volume of items reaching the bottleneck decreases, and items that do reach them match the criteria). It also specifies what it does <em>not</em> promise: that people stop escalating out of habit immediately, or that nothing important slips through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That level of specificity is what "structural move" means across every book. Every move in the library follows the same discipline: named pattern, explicit change, verification criteria, and clear limits on what it does not solve.
                </p>

                <h3>Work with AI (optional)</h3>
                <p>
                    You can load the materials into Claude, ChatGPT, or other AI tools for reflection, pattern comparison, or conversational exploration. The content is portable&mdash;it works with your workflow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AI can help you work with the material. It does not replace the recognition or the decisions. Those are yours.
                </p>

                <h3>Teach or build programs (licensed use)</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are a coach, consultant, educator, or facilitator, you can license the frameworks to teach them in professional settings, integrate them into your own programs, or build courses for your clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practitioner and institutional licenses define scope, usage rights, and deployment conditions.

                <p>
                    If you already recognize what kind of situation you're in, the homepage will point you to the relevant entry book.

                    If you're not sure, the Navigator can help. Describe what's happening and it will direct you to the right shelf. It's not a chatbot&mdash;it doesn't interpret or advise. It helps you find the book that names what you're looking at. The work happens in the books.

                <p>
                    The library is organized around one signal and three causes:
