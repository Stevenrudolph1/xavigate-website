                <h2>What You Get</h2>
                <p>
                    When you buy here, you're buying <strong>intellectual property</strong>—books, toolkits,
                    frameworks, methodologies. You pay once, own it forever, and use it however you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Permanent ownership. Like buying a book or a professional toolkit.

            <div class="reason-item">
                <h3>1. You Own It Forever</h3>
                <p>
                    Buy once. It's yours. Use it for one project or a hundred—your choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a new version releases, you decide if you want it. Keep using what you have, or buy the update. Your call.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="reason-item">
                <h3>2. Complete Control Over How You Use It</h3>
                <p>
                    You get the books, frameworks, and tools. Apply them however makes sense for your work—in your LMS, your practice, your organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The content is portable and flexible. Use it with your existing tools and systems.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="reason-item">
                <h3>3. Your Data Stays Yours</h3>
                <p>
                    Everything you build with the material lives on your infrastructure, in your systems. Your work remains under your control.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="reason-item">
                <h3>4. Predictable, Transparent Costs</h3>
                <p>
                    One-time purchase. You know exactly what you're paying and what you're getting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Budget once, own forever.

            </div>

            <div class="reason-item">
                <h3>5. Works with Your Existing Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    Books and frameworks integrate with whatever you're already using. LMS, publishing platform, business system—the content is platform-agnostic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apply it wherever makes sense for your work.
