            <p class="page-intro">
                You buy it, you own it, you use it wherever you want. No platform. No subscription. No lock-in.
            </p>

    <!-- The Model -->
    <section class="model-section">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="model-content">
                <h2>What You Get</h2>
                <p>
                    Books, toolkits, frameworks, methodologies. You pay once and you own it. Use it however you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's no platform to log into. Nothing expires. You download the material, you keep it, you return to it when the situation requires. Most things that call themselves "tools" need you to come back to their site every time. This doesn't.
                </p>

                <h2>How Ownership Works</h2>
                <p>
                    What you buy is yours permanently. One project or a hundred&mdash;your LMS, your practice, your organization. When a new version releases, you decide whether you want it. What you already have doesn't stop working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Programs you create, content you develop, client work you deliver&mdash;that's your intellectual property. The license gives you rights to use the frameworks. What you build with them belongs to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The material works with whatever tools you already use&mdash;including AI. Load it into Claude, ChatGPT, or any tool that supports your workflow. It travels with you, not with us.
                </p>

                <h2>What It Costs</h2>
                <p>
                    One-time purchases. No subscriptions, no recurring fees, no annual renewals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Four books are free&mdash;one for each area. No email required, no signup, no drip sequence. Just download them. Additional books are paid individually. Professional use requires a practitioner license. <a href="pricing.html">Full pricing details here.</a>
