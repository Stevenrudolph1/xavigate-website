                <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
                <p>
                    The material is designed to travel with whatever tools you use. That includes AI.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Load the books into AI tools.</strong> Claude, ChatGPT, whatever you work with. Analyze, summarize, ask questions, explore applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Have conversations about the frameworks.</strong> Test ideas, compare patterns, reflect on your own situations&mdash;however helps you engage with the work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply it in your practice.</strong> If you hold a practitioner license, use AI to support client work, prepare sessions, develop your own materials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use it wherever you work.</strong> LMS, notes app, coaching platform, AI assistant&mdash;your call. The material travels with you.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What You Cannot Do</h2>
                <p>
                    The following uses are prohibited without explicit written permission:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Train AI models on Xavigate content.</strong> You may not use the material to fine-tune, train, or otherwise improve AI systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Build commercial AI systems using the content.</strong> RAG systems, chatbots, or AI services that redistribute Xavigate content to others require licensing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create derivative commercial products via AI.</strong> Using AI to process and repackage the work into courses, programs, or tools for sale requires licensing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Where the Line Is</h2>
                <p>
                    If you're using AI to support your own learning and practice, that's personal use. Encouraged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're building systems or services for others using the material, that's commercial use. That requires a license. The structure, language, and distinctions in this work took decades to develop. Personal use is free. Commercial redistribution isn't.
                </p>

                <h2>For Practitioners</h2>
                <p>
                    If you hold a Practitioner License, AI is part of your toolkit&mdash;same as any other tool you use with clients. Prepare sessions, develop materials, support your work. What you cannot do is redistribute the material itself or create competing products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not sure if your use case requires additional licensing? <a href="contact.html">Ask us</a>. We'd rather help you use the work than create barriers to it.
                </p>

                <h2>Enforcement</h2>
                <p>
                    We don't police personal use. If you own the material and you're working with it privately, there's nothing to enforce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Commercial misuse is different. Building products, services, or systems for others using this material&mdash;through AI or otherwise&mdash;requires a license. Same rule whether you're using AI or doing it by hand.
                </p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Use AI however it helps.</strong> Load the books. Ask questions. Test ideas. The material travels with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Don't train models or redistribute the content.</strong> If you want to build something commercial, <a href="contact.html">let's talk about licensing</a>.
