                <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
                <p>
                    When you own Xavigate material, you can:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Load books into AI tools for personal use.</strong> Use Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI you work with to analyze, summarize, ask questions, or work with the material in your own workflow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use AI to support your understanding.</strong> Have conversations about the frameworks, test ideas, explore applications—however helps you engage with the work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply it in your practice.</strong> If you're a practitioner using Xavigate professionally, you can use AI to support client work, prepare sessions, or develop your own materials—within the scope of your license.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What You Cannot Do</h2>
                <p>
                    The following uses are prohibited without explicit written permission:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Train AI models on Xavigate content.</strong> You may not use the material to fine-tune, train, or otherwise improve AI systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create RAG systems or embeddings for commercial distribution.</strong> Building retrieval-augmented generation systems, vector databases, or embedding libraries containing Xavigate material for use by others requires licensing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redistribute material through AI systems.</strong> You may not create public or commercial AI agents, chatbots, or services that redistribute Xavigate content—even in processed form.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use AI to generate derivative commercial products.</strong> Creating courses, coaching programs, assessment tools, or other commercial offerings by having AI process and repackage the work is not permitted without licensing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Xavigate material is designed to travel with whatever tools you use. That includes AI. But the structure, language, and distinctions in the work took decades to develop—and they have commercial value when applied professionally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal use with AI is encouraged. Commercial use requires a license. The line is clear: if you're using AI to support your own learning and practice, that's personal use. If you're building systems or services for others using the material, that's commercial use.
                </p>

                <h2>For Practitioners</h2>
                <p>
                    If you hold a Practitioner License, you can use AI as part of your professional toolkit with clients—just as you'd use any other tool to support your work. What you cannot do is redistribute the material itself (through AI or otherwise) or create competing products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're unsure whether your intended use requires additional licensing, <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>. We're here to make this work, not to create barriers.
                </p>

                <h2>Enforcement</h2>
                <p>
                    We don't police personal use. If you own the material and you're using AI to work with it privately, there's nothing to enforce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do protect against commercial misuse. If you're building products, services, or systems for others using Xavigate material processed through AI, you need a license—same as if you were doing it manually.
                </p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Use AI however helps you engage with the work.</strong> Load the books. Ask questions. Test ideas. Work with the material in whatever way makes sense for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Don't train models, build commercial systems, or redistribute the content.</strong> If you want to do that, let's talk about licensing.
                </p>
