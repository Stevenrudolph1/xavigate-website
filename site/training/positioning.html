                The session went sideways. Not because of the client. Because of you — and you didn't see it until afterward.

                <p class="course-hook">Every practitioner has a default mode. The way you show up when you're not thinking about how you're showing up. For some, it's advice-giving. For others, it's holding space. For others, it's asking questions. None of these are wrong. But when you can't get out of one, everything looks like a nail.</p>

                <p>The problem isn't the mode. It's getting stuck in it. When a coach only coaches, a therapist only holds space, or a consultant only advises — they're not choosing. They're defaulting. And the client pays for it, because the response they're getting isn't matched to what the situation needs.</p>

                <p>This course teaches you to see your own patterns in real time. To catch when you've collapsed into one mode, to move deliberately when the situation calls for something else, and to recover when the way you showed up broke trust.</p>

                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>How This Course Works</h2>

                <h3>Build a Learning Portfolio</h3>
                <p>You can't learn to see your own patterns by reading about patterns. You learn it by catching yourself in the act — reviewing real sessions, noticing where you defaulted, and planning what a deliberate move would have looked like. You build a <strong>Learning Portfolio</strong>: a set of documents (Google Docs or Word) where you analyze your own positioning in real situations. By the end, you haven't just learned the concepts. You've started building the muscle of watching yourself in real time.</p>

                <h3>Everything Is Yours to Keep</h3>
                <p>No platform. No login. No software that expires. When you enroll, you receive the complete course materials — manual, exercises, case walkthroughs, submission prompts. They're yours permanently.</p>

                <h3>How Review Works</h3>
                <p>When you submit your portfolio, Steven Rudolph reviews your work directly inside your documents — inline comments on where your analysis landed, where it drifted, and what a sharper read would look like. You also receive a final review report.</p>

                <h3>The Live Instructor Track</h3>
                <p>Same materials, same standard. You also get up to 2.5 hours of live 1-on-1 time via Zoom. Positioning is the hardest to see in yourself — live practice is where the real shifts happen.</p>
