                <p class="course-hook">MNTEST is the assessment tool that maps what naturally engages a person and what doesn't. It doesn't measure personality or preferences. It measures the types of engagement that give someone energy — and the ones that cost them.</p>

                <p>With a completed MNTEST profile, you can see the fit between a person and their work in a way that conversation alone can't reveal. You can show someone — with data — why they're thriving in one part of their role and depleted by another. Why a lateral move that looked like a step down turned out to be a relief. Why a promotion they wanted is quietly destroying them.</p>

                <p>This course teaches you to administer the test, read the results, walk someone through their profile, and apply the insights in practice — across education, coaching, organizational development, and counseling.</p>

                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>You get everything upfront.</h3>
                        <p>No platform. No login. No software that expires. When you enroll, you receive the complete training materials &mdash; manual, practice profiles, orientation session guide, application contexts. They're yours permanently.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>You learn by interpreting real profiles.</h3>
                        <p>An assessment tool is only as good as the person reading it. You work through practice profiles, find the patterns, and build orientation sessions you'd actually give. Everything you produce goes into a <strong>Learning Portfolio</strong> &mdash; your own profile interpretations and session plans, developed as you go.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>You submit it. Steven reviews it.</h3>
                        <p>Not a grade. Steven Rudolph reads your work directly in your documents &mdash; inline comments on where your interpretation landed, where it drifted, and what a sharper read would look like. Plus a final review report.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>The Live Instructor Track</h3>
                        <p>Same materials, same standard. You also get up to 2.5 hours of live 1-on-1 time via Zoom &mdash; walking through real profiles together, practicing orientation sessions, and calibrating your reads against expert analysis.</p>
