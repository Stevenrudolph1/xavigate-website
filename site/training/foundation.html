If you've ever watched a capable person struggle and thought <em>"something isn't right here but I can't put my finger on it"</em> &mdash; this is the training that gives you the finger to put on it.</p>

                <h2>The Problem You Already Know</h2>

                <p class="course-hook">Someone is struggling. Maybe they're visibly burned out. Maybe they're performing fine but something's off. Maybe nothing is wrong, exactly&mdash;it's just flat.</p>

                <p class="course-hook">Everyone has a theory about what's wrong with <em>them</em>. Usually, everyone is wrong.</p>

                <p>The real issue is almost never the person. It's a condition in the situation &mdash; something missing in how things are set up, a mismatch between the work and who they are, or a pattern in how someone is showing up. But the default move, every time, is to skip the situation and explain the person.</p>

                <h2>What You Walk Away With</h2>

                <p>By the end of this course, you can look at a situation where someone is struggling &mdash; obviously, invisibly, or somewhere in between &mdash; and tell whether the real issue is:</p>

                        <p>Something is missing in the structure &mdash; unclear roles, heroic load, nobody carrying what needs carrying. The person looks like the problem, but the arrangement is.</p>

                        <p>The work demands one kind of engagement; the person supplies another. Sometimes the mismatch is obvious. Sometimes it hides behind competence for years.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>

                <p>This isn't a course where you watch videos and take a quiz. It's built around <em>doing the analysis</em> &mdash; on real situations, from the beginning.</p>

                <div class="course-mechanic-list">

                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>You read. Then you use it.</h3>
                        <p>The course manual teaches the concepts with worked examples. Then exercises ask you to apply them &mdash; not to hypothetical scenarios, but to situations you actually recognize. Three modules take you from catching the default misread, to telling similar-looking problems apart, to holding your analysis under pressure.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>You build a Learning Portfolio.</h3>
                        <p>A set of documents (Google Docs or Word) where you work through exercises, develop case analyses, and build a body of practiced thinking. By the end, you haven't just studied something. You've built evidence of how you see.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>You submit it. Steven reviews it.</h3>
                        <p>Not a grade. Steven Rudolph reads your work directly in your documents &mdash; inline comments on where your analysis landed, where it drifted, and what a sharper read would look like. Plus a final review report. It's a detailed, honest read of how you're seeing.</p>
