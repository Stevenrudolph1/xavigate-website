                <!-- THE PROBLEM                      -->
                <!-- ================================ -->

                <p class="course-hook">Someone is struggling. Maybe they're visibly burned out. Maybe they're performing fine but something's off. Maybe nothing is wrong, exactly&mdash;it's just flat. Everyone has a theory about what's wrong with <em>them</em>.</p>

                <p class="course-hook">Usually, everyone is wrong.</p>

                <p>The real issue is almost never the person. It's a condition in the situation&mdash;something missing in how the work is set up, a mismatch between the work and who they are, or a pattern in how someone is showing up. The presentation varies. The structural fact doesn't. But the default move, every time, is to skip the situation and explain the person.</p>

                <p>This course teaches you to stop doing that. By the end, you can tell whether the real issue is how the work is set up, how well it fits the person, or how someone is showing up in the room — and why getting that right changes everything that comes after.</p>

                <!-- HOW THIS COURSE WORKS            -->
                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>How This Course Works</h2>

                <p>The point of this training isn't a credential. It's a shift in how you see.</p>

                <h3>Build a Learning Portfolio</h3>
                <p>Most courses hand you content and check whether you absorbed it. This one asks you to <em>use</em> it — on real situations, from the beginning. You build a <strong>Learning Portfolio</strong>: a set of documents (Google Docs or Word) where you do your analysis, work through exercises, and develop your own case work. By the end, you haven't just studied the framework. You've built a body of practiced analysis that shows how you think.</p>

                <h3>Everything Is Yours to Keep</h3>
                <p>No platform. No login. No software that expires. When you enroll, you receive the complete course materials — manual, exercises, case walkthroughs, submission prompts. They're yours permanently.</p>

                <h3>How Review Works</h3>
                <p>When you submit your portfolio, Steven Rudolph reviews your work directly inside your documents — inline comments on where your analysis landed, where it drifted, and what a sharper read would look like. You also receive a final review report. It's not a grade. It's a detailed, honest read of how you're seeing.</p>

                <h3>The Live Instructor Track</h3>
                <p>Same materials, same standard. You also get up to 2.5 hours of live 1-on-1 time via Zoom — working through your actual cases, getting real-time feedback, and calibrating your reads against expert analysis.</p>

                        <p>Why the default explanation is almost always wrong. You learn the Renergence premise&mdash;that when someone is burned out, quietly off, or just flat, the cause is usually a condition in the situation, not a deficit in the person&mdash;and start catching the moment where your own read goes sideways.</p>
