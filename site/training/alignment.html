            <h1>Alignment: When the Situation Doesn't Fit</h1>
            <p class="page-intro">
                Something about the situation doesn't fit who they are. Sometimes that's obvious. Sometimes it hides behind years of competence. Either way, it costs. This course uses the <strong>Multiple Natures</strong> model to show you exactly where the gap is.

                <p class="course-hook">Some people are depleted not because the work is badly structured or because something is broken. The structure is fine. They're just good at work that fights who they are.</p>

                <p>They show up, perform, deliver. Everyone says they're thriving. But the energy to do it isn't coming from the work &mdash; they're manufacturing it. Every situation pulls for certain kinds of engagement. When what a person naturally supplies matches what the situation demands, energy comes back. When it doesn't, they spend energy just to show up &mdash; and that cost compounds over time, sometimes visibly, sometimes not.</p>

                <p>This course teaches you to read that gap using the <strong>Multiple Natures</strong> model &mdash; a system for mapping the recurring pulls people move toward naturally (what engages them) vs. what they have to force. You'll learn to tell the difference between "energized by the work" and "good at pushing through it," and to surface what's happening in a conversation without triggering a crisis.</p>

                <h2>How This Course Works</h2>

                <div class="course-mechanic-list">

                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>You get everything upfront.</h3>
                        <p>No platform. No login. No software that expires. When you enroll, you receive the complete course materials &mdash; manual, exercises, case walkthroughs, submission prompts. They're yours permanently.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>You learn by sitting with real situations.</h3>
                        <p>You can't learn to surface what's costing someone by answering quiz questions. You map what energizes, spot what drains, and plan conversations you'd actually have. Everything you produce goes into a <strong>Learning Portfolio</strong> &mdash; your own alignment analyses and conversation plans, developed as you go.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="course-mechanic">
                        <h3>You submit it. Steven reviews it.</h3>
                        <p>Not a grade. Steven Rudolph reads your work directly in your documents &mdash; inline comments on where your analysis landed, where it drifted, and what a sharper read would look like. Plus a final review report.</p>

                    <div class="course-mechanic">

                        <p>Same materials, same standard. You also get up to 2.5 hours of live 1-on-1 time via Zoom &mdash; practicing the alignment conversation in real time, getting feedback on your cost reads, and working through actual cases together.</p>
