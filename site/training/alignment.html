                <p class="course-hook">Some people are depleted not because the work is badly structured or because something is broken. The structure is fine. They're just good at work that fights who they are.</p>

                <p>They show up, perform, deliver. Everyone says they're thriving. But the energy to do it isn't coming from the work — they're manufacturing it. And that manufacturing has a cost that nobody sees, sometimes not even the person paying it.</p>

                <p>This course teaches you to see the cost. To tell the difference between "energized by the work" and "good at forcing themselves to show up." And to surface what's happening in a conversation without triggering a crisis — because the person often doesn't know this is happening to them.</p>

                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>How This Course Works</h2>

                <h3>Build a Learning Portfolio</h3>
                <p>Alignment work is personal. You can't learn to surface what's costing someone by answering quiz questions. You learn it by sitting with real situations — mapping what energizes, spotting what drains, and planning conversations you'd actually have. You build a <strong>Learning Portfolio</strong>: a set of documents (Google Docs or Word) where you develop your own alignment analyses and conversation plans. By the end, you've built something you can actually use — not just course notes, but a practiced way of seeing.</p>

                <h3>Everything Is Yours to Keep</h3>
                <p>No platform. No login. No software that expires. When you enroll, you receive the complete course materials — manual, exercises, case walkthroughs, submission prompts. They're yours permanently.</p>

                <h3>How Review Works</h3>
                <p>When you submit your portfolio, Steven Rudolph reviews your work directly inside your documents — inline comments on where your analysis landed, where it drifted, and what a sharper read would look like. You also receive a final review report.</p>

                <h3>The Live Instructor Track</h3>
                <p>Same materials, same standard. You also get up to 2.5 hours of live 1-on-1 time via Zoom — practicing the alignment conversation in real time, getting feedback on your cost reads, and working through actual cases together.</p>
