            <h1>Structure: Finding What's Missing</h1>
            <p class="page-intro">
                When people carry too much, the instinct is to help them carry it better. The real question is: why are they carrying it at all?
            </p>

                <p class="course-hook">Someone is doing the work of three people. Staying late. Holding things together. Everyone calls them "dedicated." Nobody asks why the system needs a hero to function.</p>

                <p>Usually, something is missing — a decision that was never made, a role that was never defined, a process that doesn't exist, authority that was never granted, knowledge that lives in one person's head. The person isn't the problem. The absence is. But the person is the one feeling it.</p>

                <p>This course teaches you to find the absence, name it, and design the fix. Not a better coping strategy. Not a pep talk about delegation. An actual structural change that means the person doesn't have to carry it anymore.</p>

                <!-- HOW THIS COURSE WORKS            -->
                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>How This Course Works</h2>

                <p>You don't learn structural analysis by reading about it. You learn it by doing it — finding real absences, auditing real loads, designing real fixes. As you work through the materials, you build a <strong>Learning Portfolio</strong>: a set of documents (Google Docs or Word) where you develop your own structural analyses from the ground up. By the end, you haven't just studied the concepts. You've built a body of work that shows how you think about systems.</p>

                <p>No platform. No login. No software that expires. When you enroll, you receive the complete course materials — manual, exercises, case walkthroughs, submission prompts. They're yours to keep.</p>

                <p>When you submit your portfolio, Steven Rudolph reviews your work directly inside your documents — inline comments where your analysis landed, where it drifted, and what a sharper read would look like. You also receive a final review report that ties it all together.</p>

                <p>If you choose the <strong>With Live Instructor</strong> track, you also get up to 2.5 hours of live 1-on-1 time via Zoom — working through your actual structural cases, getting real-time feedback on your audits and intervention designs.</p>

                <h2>What You Learn</h2>

                <ul class="pricing-features">
                    <li>The 5 things that go missing in organizations — unclear decisions, undefined roles, broken processes, missing authority, lost knowledge</li>
                    <li>How to audit what people are carrying that the system should handle</li>
                    <li>Spotting when one person becomes the bottleneck — and why the system made it happen</li>
                    <li>Designing fixes that change the structure, not the person</li>
                    <li>When "the structure is fine" and the real issue is somewhere else</li>
                </ul>

                        <p>Organizations don't break loudly. They break by omission — something was never built, never decided, never defined. People fill the gap with personal effort, and everyone calls it leadership. This module teaches you to see the five structural absences that create heroic load.</p>
                        <ul class="pricing-features">
                            <li>Decision absence — when nobody knows who decides what</li>
                            <li>Role absence — when responsibilities exist without clear ownership</li>
                            <li>Process absence — when every situation is handled ad hoc</li>
                            <li>Authority absence — when people have responsibility without the power to act</li>
                            <li>Knowledge absence — when critical information lives in one person</li>
                            <li>Exercises: Identifying which absence is driving the load in real situations</li>
