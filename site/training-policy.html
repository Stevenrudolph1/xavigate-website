                <h2>Why We Don't Certify</h2>

                <p>
                    Structural seeing is a skill, not a status. You develop it through practice and it sharpens or dulls depending on how you use it. Attaching a permanent credential to a temporal skill creates a false signal — it suggests that something completed once remains true indefinitely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don't certify people because certification implies we can guarantee what someone will do with what they learned. We can't. We can confirm that you completed rigorous training and demonstrated structural seeing at the time of completion. What you build with that skill is yours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This isn't a limitation. It's a design choice. Structural diagnosis works because it stays honest about what it can and cannot see. The same principle applies to how we recognize the people who learn it.
                </p>

                <!-- WHAT COMPLETION MEANS            -->
                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>What Completion Means</h2>

                <p>
                    Completion reflects participation in the training and demonstrated competence in structural diagnosis at the time of evaluation. It is not a credentialing or authorization process.
                </p>

                <div style="margin: var(--space-site-md) 0 var(--space-site-lg); padding: var(--space-site-md); background: var(--bg-subtle); border-left: 3px solid var(--thread-renergence);">
                    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: var(--text-lg); font-weight: var(--weight-medium);">
                        "Completed Renergence for Practitioners Training — 2026"

                    <p style="margin: var(--space-site-sm) 0 0; color: var(--text-secondary);">
                        The year matters. It signals recency, not rank. Learning is temporal, not permanent.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    You earn completion by submitting case work that demonstrates structural seeing — the ability to identify structural conditions rather than defaulting to personal narratives about those same situations. Each submission receives detailed expert feedback. Cases that don't yet demonstrate structural seeing are returned with specific guidance and up to two revisions.
                </p>

                <h2>What Completion Permits</h2>

                <h3>You may</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>State that you completed the training: "Completed RPT (2026)"</li>
                    <li>Reference the training in your professional materials</li>
                    <li>Say you are trained in the Renergence framework</li>
                    <li>Describe that you use Renergence structural diagnosis in your work</li>
                    <li>Opt in to the public completers directory</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>You may not</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Say you are "certified by" Xavigate or Renergence</li>
                    <li>Use "Official Renergence Practitioner" or similar titles</li>
                    <li>Imply endorsement, authorization, or affiliation</li>
                    <li>Use the Renergence or Xavigate trademarks as credentials or professional titles</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: var(--space-site-md); color: var(--text-secondary);">
                    The distinction: you can describe what you did and what you use. You cannot claim a status that was never granted.
                </p>

                <!-- ================================ -->
                <!-- COMPLETERS DIRECTORY             -->
                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>Completers Directory</h2>

                <p>
                    We maintain a voluntary, factual record of individuals who completed the training. It is not a certification, endorsement, or authorization. It is a list of people who did the work.
                </p>

                <div style="margin: var(--space-site-md) 0; padding: var(--space-site-md); background: var(--bg-subtle); border-left: 3px solid var(--thread-hnr);">
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">How the directory works</h3>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        <li><strong>Opt-in only</strong> — at completion, you choose whether to be listed publicly</li>
                        <li><strong>Factual only</strong> — name, year, and courses completed. No ratings, no rankings, no badges</li>
                        <li><strong>Free</strong> — no annual fee, no renewal, no subscription</li>
                        <li><strong>Permanent</strong> — your completion record does not expire or require maintenance</li>
                        <li><strong>Removable</strong> — you can request removal at any time</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The directory exists because structural diagnosis training is more useful when the people who completed it can be found. That's its only purpose.
                </p>

                <!-- ================================ -->
                <!-- CASE SUBMISSION PROCESS          -->
                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>The Case Submission Process</h2>

                <p>Each course requires case submissions — structured analyses of real situations using the diagnostic methodology taught in that course.</p>

                <h3>What you submit</h3>
                <p>A structured case analysis following provided prompts. Each submission includes: the situation (anonymized), domain identification with evidence, structural analysis, intervention logic, and a self-critique section where you examine what might be wrong with your own read.</p>

                <h3>What you receive back</h3>
                <p>Detailed structural critique — not a score. Where your analysis demonstrated structural seeing. Where it drifted into personal narrative. Where you missed a structural signal. Where your intervention addressed symptoms instead of structure. What the expert read would look like for your specific case.</p>

                <h3>The standard</h3>

                <div style="margin: var(--space-site-md) 0; padding: var(--space-site-md); background: var(--surface-page); border-radius: var(--site-radius-sm);">
                    <p style="margin: 0 0 var(--space-site-sm);"><strong>Pass</strong> — structural condition identified, evidence-based, self-critical. Completion recorded.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0 0 var(--space-site-sm);"><strong>Revise</strong> — close, but drifts into narrative or misroutes. Returned with specific feedback. Up to 2 revisions.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Does not pass</strong> — personal narrative presented as structural analysis. After 2 revision attempts: 90-day cooldown before retaking.</p>
                </div>

                <p style="margin-top: var(--space-site-md);">
                    The standard is structural seeing, not perfection. We're looking for whether you can identify the structural condition underneath a situation — not whether you agree with a particular read.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Each case submission allows up to <strong>2 revisions</strong></li>
                    <li>Revisions include specific feedback on what to address</li>
                    <li>If a case does not pass after 2 revisions: <strong>90-day cooldown</strong> before retaking that course</li>
                    <li>Cooldown is not punishment — it's time for the structural seeing to develop through practice</li>
                </ul>
