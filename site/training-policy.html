                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>What Completion Means</h2>

                <p>
                    Completion reflects demonstrated competence in Renergence diagnosis — across Structure, Alignment, and Positioning — at the time of evaluation. You earn it by submitting case work that shows diagnostic seeing: the ability to identify conditions rather than defaulting to personal narratives about those same situations.
                </p>

                <div style="margin: var(--space-site-md) 0 var(--space-site-lg); padding: var(--space-site-md); background: var(--bg-subtle); border-left: 3px solid var(--thread-renergence);">
                    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: var(--text-lg); font-weight: var(--weight-medium);">
                        "Completed Renergence for Practitioners Training — 2026"
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin: var(--space-site-sm) 0 0; color: var(--text-secondary);">
                        The year matters. It signals recency, not rank. Learning is temporal, not permanent.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Each submission receives detailed expert feedback. Cases that don't yet demonstrate diagnostic seeing are returned with specific guidance and up to two revisions.
                </p>

                <!-- WHAT YOU MAY DO                  -->
                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>What Completion Permits</h2>

                <h3>You may</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>State that you completed the training: "Completed RPT (2026)"</li>
                    <li>Reference the training in your professional materials</li>
                    <li>Say you are trained in the Renergence framework</li>
                    <li>Describe that you use Renergence diagnosis in your work</li>
                    <li>Opt in to the public completers directory</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>You may not</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Say you are "certified by" Xavigate or Renergence</li>
                    <li>Use "Official Renergence Practitioner" or similar titles</li>
                    <li>Imply endorsement, authorization, or affiliation</li>
                    <li>Use the Renergence or Xavigate trademarks as credentials or professional titles</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: var(--space-site-md); color: var(--text-secondary);">
                    The distinction: you can describe what you did and what you use. You cannot claim a status that was never granted.
                </p>

                <!-- ================================ -->
                <!-- THE PHILOSOPHY                   -->
                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>Why We Don't Certify</h2>

                <p>
                    Diagnostic seeing is a skill, not a status. You develop it through practice and it sharpens or dulls depending on how you use it. Attaching a permanent credential to a temporal skill creates a false signal — it suggests that something completed once remains true indefinitely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don't certify people because certification implies we can guarantee what someone will do with what they learned. We can't. We can confirm that you completed rigorous training and demonstrated diagnostic seeing — across Structure, Alignment, and Positioning — at the time of completion. What you build with that skill is yours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This isn't a limitation. It's a design choice. The Renergence framework works because it stays honest about what it can and cannot see. The same principle applies to how we recognize the people who learn it.
                </p>

                <!-- ================================ -->
                <!-- CASE SUBMISSION PROCESS          -->
                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>The Case Submission Process</h2>

                <p>Each course requires case submissions — structured analyses of real situations using the diagnostic methodology taught in that course.</p>

                <h3>What you submit</h3>
                <p>A case analysis following provided prompts. Each submission includes: the situation (anonymized), domain identification with evidence, analysis of the condition (Structure, Alignment, or Positioning), intervention logic, and a self-critique section where you examine what might be wrong with your own read.</p>

                <h3>What you receive back</h3>
                <p>Detailed diagnostic critique — not a score. Where your analysis demonstrated real seeing. Where it drifted into personal narrative. Where you missed a signal. Where your intervention addressed symptoms instead of the underlying condition. What the expert read would look like for your specific case.</p>

                <h3>How we evaluate</h3>

                <p>Every case submission is reviewed across six dimensions:</p>

                <div style="margin: var(--space-site-md) 0; padding: var(--space-site-md); background: var(--bg-subtle); border-left: 3px solid var(--thread-renergence);">
                    <ul style="margin: 0;">
                        <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-site-xs);"><strong>Domain identification</strong> — did you correctly identify which domain (Structure, Alignment, or Positioning) is operating?</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-site-xs);"><strong>Evidence quality</strong> — is the identification based on observable evidence or assumed from the narrative?</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-site-xs);"><strong>Condition analysis</strong> — did you describe the actual condition (structural absence, engagement mismatch, mode collapse) or drift into personality/motivation language?</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-site-xs);"><strong>Intervention logic</strong> — does the proposed intervention address the condition or the person?</li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: var(--space-site-xs);"><strong>Self-critique</strong> — did you identify what might be wrong with your own read?</li>
                        <li><strong>Narrative discipline</strong> — did you maintain the diagnostic frame or collapse back into coaching/therapy/management defaults?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>The standard</h3>

                <div style="margin: var(--space-site-md) 0; padding: var(--space-site-md); background: var(--surface-page); border-radius: var(--site-radius-sm);">
                    <p style="margin: 0 0 var(--space-site-sm);"><strong>Pass</strong> — condition identified, evidence-based, self-critical. Completion recorded.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0 0 var(--space-site-sm);"><strong>Revise</strong> — close, but drifts into narrative or misroutes the domain. Returned with specific feedback.</p>
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Does not pass</strong> — personal narrative presented as diagnosis.</p>
                </div>

                <p style="margin-top: var(--space-site-md);">
                    The standard is diagnostic seeing, not perfection. We're looking for whether you can identify the condition underneath a situation — Structure, Alignment, or Positioning — rather than defaulting to the personal narrative. Not whether you agree with a particular read.
                </p>

                <!-- ================================ -->
                <!-- RESUBMISSION POLICY              -->
                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>Resubmission Policy</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First revision</strong> — included with the course. You receive specific feedback on what to address and resubmit</li>
                    <li><strong>Second revision</strong> — available for a <strong>$100 resubmission fee</strong>. Same detailed feedback, same standard</li>
                    <li>If a case does not pass after the second revision: <strong>90-day cooldown</strong> before retaking that course</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The first revision is part of the learning process — most people need it. The fee on the second revision reflects the real cost of expert review and ensures submissions are taken seriously. The cooldown isn't punishment — it's time for the diagnostic seeing to develop through practice before trying again.
                </p>

                <!-- ================================ -->
                <!-- TWO TRACKS                       -->
                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>Two Tracks, Same Standard</h2>

                <p>Every course is available in two tracks. The completion standard is identical — same case submissions, same evaluation dimensions, same pass threshold.</p>

                <p>Steven reviews all case submissions personally in both tracks. The difference is the format of interaction.</p>

                <div style="margin: var(--space-site-md) 0; padding: var(--space-site-md); background: var(--bg-subtle); border-left: 3px solid var(--thread-engagement);">
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Self-Paced — $499 per course</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">
                        Full course materials, exercises, worked case walkthroughs, and structured submission prompts. Steven reviews your case submissions and provides detailed written feedback — where your analysis demonstrated diagnostic seeing, where it drifted, and what the expert read would look like. Written response only, no live interaction.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin: var(--space-site-md) 0; padding: var(--space-site-md); background: var(--bg-subtle); border-left: 3px solid var(--thread-renergence);">
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">With Steven Rudolph — $1,499 per course</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">
                        Everything in Self-Paced, plus up to 2.5 hours of live individual time with Steven. Case discussion, real-time diagnostic feedback, and practice refinement.

                <p style="margin-top: var(--space-site-md);">
                    Both tracks produce the same completion record. The difference is access — written feedback vs. written feedback plus live conversation.

                <!-- ================================ -->

                <h2>Completers Directory</h2>

                <p>
                    We maintain a voluntary, factual record of individuals who completed the training. It is not a certification, endorsement, or authorization. It is a list of people who did the work.
                </p>

                <div style="margin: var(--space-site-md) 0; padding: var(--space-site-md); background: var(--bg-subtle); border-left: 3px solid var(--thread-hnr);">
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">How the directory works</h3>
                    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        <li><strong>Opt-in only</strong> — at completion, you choose whether to be listed publicly</li>
                        <li><strong>Factual only</strong> — name, year, and courses completed. No ratings, no rankings, no badges</li>
                        <li><strong>Free</strong> — no annual fee, no renewal, no subscription</li>
                        <li><strong>Permanent</strong> — your completion record does not expire or require maintenance</li>
                        <li><strong>Removable</strong> — you can request removal at any time</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The directory exists because the training is more useful when the people who completed it can be found. That's its only purpose.
